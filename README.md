# WTF Bot

A fancy fork of the VA's WTF Bot.



## Getting Started

First, you need to decide on acronyms. You can find a template here: [TheBoatyMcBoatFace/acronyms](https://github.com/TheBoatyMcBoatFace/acronyms/)








# wtf-bot

A Flask application that powers the /wtf Slack command. Inspired by a [previous incarnation](https://github.com/paultag/wtf) of similar functionality. Relies on the VA [acronym list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/acronyms).

## Install to slack

If using a VA slack instance, you can configure an instance of this bot into your slack.
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Create a new slack app in your workspace, using the [manifest](slack_app_config.yaml). Instructions to do this are [here](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests#creating_apps).
2. Get the app approved by your administrators and add it to your workspace.
3. Submit a ticket to the [DOTS service desk](https://vajira.max.gov/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/17) and provide the 'Verification Token' available in the `Basic Information / App Config` section of your bot config.
This token is used to validate your requests to the wtf-bot.
4. DOTS will inform you when the token has been added, and will provide you with the URL to the wtf-bot service. This
URL should be added to your app config to replace the `http://replace.me.com/slack` link.
5. Test out the wtf-bot in your slack with `/wtf VA` - it should work!

## Local development

Clone this repo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/wtf-bot.git
$ cd /path/to/wtf-bot/
```

### Create and configure virtual environment.

Make sure you have the correct version of python. [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) manages python versions.
  1. `pyenv install 3.8.12` (use version in `.python-version`)
  2. Make sure to configure your shell's environment for pyenv following instructions in step 2
    [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout).
  3. Once this is done, start a new shell and run `pyenv version` and `python --version` in the terminal from the root directory of the project, both should read `3.8.12`
